  abstract  = {Data structures with a hole, in other words data structures with an uninitialized field, are useful to write efficient programs: they enable us to construct functional data structures flexibly and write functions such as append and map as tail recursive functions. In this paper we present an approach to introducing data structures with a hole into call-by-value functional programming languages like ML. Data structures with a hole are formalized as a new form of λ-abstraction called hole abstraction. The novel features of hole abstraction are that expressions inside hole abstraction are evaluated and application is implemented by destructive update of a hole. We present a simply typed call-by-value λ-calculus extended with hole abstractions. Then we show a compilation method of hole abstraction and prove correctness of the compilation.},

@article{bour_tmc_2021,
  abstract = {OCaml function calls consume space on the system stack. Operating systems set default limits on the stack space which are much lower than the available memory. If a program runs out of stack space, they get the dreaded "Stack Overflow" exception -- they crash. As a result, OCaml programmers have to be careful, when they write recursive functions, to remain in the so-called \_tail-recursive\_ fragment, using \_tail\_ calls that do not consume stack space. This discipline is a source of difficulties for both beginners and experts. Beginners have to be taught recursion, and then tail-recursion. Experts disagree on the "right" way to write `List.map`. The direct version is beautiful but not tail-recursive, so it crashes on larger inputs. The naive tail-recursive transformation is (slightly) slower than the direct version, and experts may want to avoid that cost. Some libraries propose horrible implementations, unrolling code by hand, to compensate for this performance loss. In general, tail-recursion requires the programmer to manually perform sophisticated program transformations. In this work we propose an implementation of "Tail Modulo Cons" (TMC) for OCaml. TMC is a program transformation for a fragment of non-tail-recursive functions, that rewrites them in \_destination-passing style\_. The supported fragment is smaller than other approaches such as continuation-passing-style, but the performance of the transformed code is on par with the direct, non-tail-recursive version. Many useful functions that traverse a recursive datastructure and rebuild another recursive structure are in the TMC fragment, in particular `List.map` (and `List.filter`, `List.append`, etc.). Finally those functions can be written in a way that is beautiful, correct on all inputs, and efficient.},

We describe Compact Normal Forms, an API that allows programmers to explicitly place immutable heap objects into regions, which can both be accessed like ordinary data as well as efﬁciently transmitted over the network. The process of placing objects into compact regions (essentially a copy) is faster than any serializer and can be amortized over a series of functional updates to the data structure in question. We implement this scheme in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and show that even with the space expansion attendant with memory-oriented data structure representations, we achieve between ×2 and ×4 speedups on fast local networks with sufﬁciently large data structures.},

  abstract   = {Linear type systems have a long and storied history, but not a clear path forward to integrate with existing languages such as OCaml or Haskell. In this paper, we study a linear type system designed with two crucial properties in mind: backwards-compatibility and code reuse across linear and non-linear users of a library. Only then can the benefits of linear types permeate conventional functional programming. Rather than bifurcate types into linear and non-linear counterparts, we instead attach linearity to function arrows. Linear functions can receive inputs from linearly-bound values, but can also operate over unrestricted, regular values. To demonstrate the efficacy of our linear type system - both how easy it can be integrated in an existing language implementation and how streamlined it makes it to write programs with linear types - we implemented our type system in GHC, the leading Haskell compiler, and demonstrate two kinds of applications of linear types: mutable data with pure interfaces; and enforcing protocols in I/O-performing functions.},

  abstract  = {The large-scale structure of executing a computation can often be thought of as being separated into distinct phases. But the most natural form in which to specify that computation may well have a different and conflicting structure. For example, the computation might consist of gathering data from some locations, processing it, then distributing the results back to the same locations; it may be executed in three phases—gather, process, distribute—but mostly conveniently specified orthogonally—by location. We have recently shown that this multi-phase structure can be expressed as a novel applicative functor (also known as an idiom, or lax monoidal functor). Here we summarize the idea from the perspective of software architecture. At the end, we speculate about applications to choreography and multi-tier architecture.},

@phdthesis{larus_restructuring_1989,
  abstract = {C scURARE, the program restructurer described in this dissertation, automatically transforms a sequential Lisp program into an equivalent concurrent program that executes on a multiprocessor. C scURARE first analyzes a program to find its control and data dependences. This analysis is most difficult for references to structures connected by pointers. C scURARE uses a new data-dependence algorithm, which finds and classifies these dependences. The analysis is conservative and may detect conflicts that do not arise in practice. A programmer can temper and refine its results with declarations. Dependences constrain the program's concurrent execution because, in general, two conflicting statements cannot execute in a different order without affecting the program's result. A restructurer must know all dependences in order to preserve them. However, not all dependences are essential to produce the program's result. C scURARE attempts to transform the program so it computes its result with fewer conflicts. An optimized program will execute with less synchronization and more concurrency. C scURARE then examines loops in a program to find those that are unconstrained or lightly constrained by dependences. By necessity, C scURARE treats recursive functions as loops and does not limit itself to explicit program loops. Recursive functions offer several advantages over explicit loops since they provide a convenient framework for inserting locks and handling the dynamic behavior of symbolic programs. Loops that are suitable for concurrent execution are changed to execute on a set of concurrent server processes. These servers execute single loop iterations and therefore need to be extremely inexpensive to invoke. Restructured programs execute significantly faster than the original sequential programs. This improvement is large enough to attract programmers to a multiprocessor, particularly since it requires little effort on their part. Although restructured programs may not make optimal use of a multiprocessor's parallelism, they make good use of a programmer's time.},

When declaring resources such as file handles and manually managed memory as linear arguments, a linear type system can verify that these resources are used safely. However, writing code with explicit linear arguments requires bureaucracy. This paper presents linear constraints, a front-end feature for linear typing that decreases the bureaucracy of working with linear types. Linear constraints are implicit linear arguments that are filled in automatically by the compiler. We present linear constraints as a qualified type system,together with an inference algorithm which extends GHC's existing constraint solver algorithm.

                in-place updates without requiring allocation, provided their arguments are not

                instantiation in particular and prove that an instantiation using Minamide’s hole calculus is sound. We also calculate a second instantiation in terms of the Perceus heap semantics to precisely reason about the soundness of in-place update. While all previous approaches to TRMc fail in the presence of non-linear control (for example induced by call/cc, shift/reset or algebraic effect handlers), we can elegantly extend the heap semantics to a hybrid approach which dynamically adapts to non-linear control flow. We have a full implementation of hybrid TRMc in the Koka language and our benchmark shows the TRMc transformed functions are always as fast or faster than using manual alternatives.},

@inproceedings{sewell_ott_2007,
  abstract  = {It is rare to give a semantic definition of a full-scale programming language, despite the many potential benefits. Partly this is because the available metalanguages for expressing semantics - usually either L<scp>a</scp>TEX for informal mathematics, or the formal mathematics of a proof assistant - make it much harder than necessary to work with large definitions.We present a metalanguage specifically designed for this problem, and a tool, ott, that sanity-checks such definitions and compiles them into proof assistant code for Coq, HOL, Isabelle, and (in progress) Twelf, together with L<scp>a</scp>TEX code for production-quality typesetting, and OCaml boilerplate. The main innovations are:(1) metalanguage design to make definitions concise, and easy to read and edit;(2) an expressive but intuitive metalanguage for specifying binding structures; and (3) compilation to proof assistant code.This has been tested in substantial case studies, including modular specifications of calculi from the TAPL text, a Lightweight Java with Java JSR 277/294 module system proposals, and a large fragment of OCaml (around 306 rules), with machine proofs of various soundness results. Our aim with this work is to enable a phase change: making it feasible to work routinely, without heroic effort, with rigorous semantic definitions of realistic languages.},

@article{granule_2019,
  abstract   = {In programming, some data acts as a resource (e.g., file handles, channels) subject to usage constraints. This poses a challenge to software correctness as most languages are agnostic to constraints on data. The approach of linear types provides a partial remedy, delineating data into resources to be used but never copied or discarded, and unconstrained values. Bounded Linear Logic provides a more fine-grained approach, quantifying non-linear use via an indexed-family of modalities. Recent work on coeffect types generalises this idea to graded comonads, providing type systems which can capture various program properties. Here, we propose the umbrella notion of graded modal types, encompassing coeffect types and dual notions of type-based effect reasoning via graded monads. In combination with linear and indexed types, we show that graded modal types provide an expressive type theory for quantitative program reasoning, advancing the reach of type systems to capture and verify a broader set of program properties. We demonstrate this approach via a type system embodied in a fully-fledged functional language called Granule, exploring various examples.},

@article{lorenzen_searchtree_2024,
  abstract   = {Algorithms on restructuring binary search trees are typically 
                presented in imperative pseudocode. Understandably so, as their 
                performance relies on in-place execution, rather than the repeated 
                allocation of fresh nodes in memory. Unfortunately, these imperative 
                algorithms are notoriously difficult to verify as their loop 
                invariants must relate the unfinished tree fragments being 
                rebalanced. This paper presents several novel functional algorithms 
                for accessing and inserting elements in a restructuring binary search 
                tree that are as fast as their imperative counterparts; yet the 
                correctness of these functional algorithms is established using a 
                simple inductive argument. For each data structure, move-to-root, 
                splay, and zip trees, this paper describes both a bottom-up 
                algorithm using zippers and a top-down algorithm using a novel 
                first-class constructor context primitive. 
                The functional and imperative algorithms are equivalent: 
                we mechanise the proofs establishing this in the Coq 
                proof assistant using the Iris framework. This yields a first fully 
                verified implementation of well known algorithms on binary search trees with 
                performance on par with the fastest implementations in C.},

This calculus is derived from implicational Gentzen's sequent calculus LK, a key classical logical system in proof theory. Under the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we can see LK, or more precisely a formulation called LKμ , as a syntax-directed system of simple types for μ -calculus. For μ -calculus, choosing a call-by-name or call-by-value discipline for reduction amounts to choosing one of the two possible symmetric orientations of a critical pair. Our analysis leads us to revisit the question of what is a natural syntax for call-by-value functional computation. We define a translation of λμ-calculus into μ -calculus and two dual translations back to λ-calculus, and we recover known CPS translations by composing these translations.},
